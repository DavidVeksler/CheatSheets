                        <p>Judaism's absolute cornerstone belief: God is uniquely and indivisibly One. This concept, known as <em>monotheism</em>, permeates all aspects of Jewish thought and practice.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Nature of God:</strong> God is singular (no partners, divisions, or multiplicity within the Godhead, rejecting Christian Trinity), incorporeal (no physical body or form), eternal (precedes creation, exists beyond time), omniscient (all-knowing), omnipotent (all-powerful within logic/ethics), and omnipresent (present everywhere).</li>
                            <li><strong>The Shema Prayer:</strong> The primary declaration is 'Hear O Israel, the LORD is our God, the LORD is One' (<em>Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad</em> - Deut. 6:4). Recited twice daily (morning/evening), traditionally with eyes covered to focus concentration. It's the ultimate affirmation of faith, often recited before death.</li>
                            <li><strong>Maimonides' Principles:</strong> The first five of Rambam's 13 Principles of Faith elaborate on God's existence, unity, incorporeality, eternity, and being the sole object of worship.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rejection of Idolatry (<em>Avodah Zarah</em>):</strong> Uncompromising monotheism leads to a strict prohibition against worshipping any other being, force, or representation (idols, intermediaries).</li>
                            <li><strong>Implications:</strong> God is the sole Creator, Sustainer, and Redeemer. All morality ultimately derives from this One Source. Every blessing begins by acknowledging this unique Sovereignty ('Blessed are You, LORD our God, King of the universe...').</li>

                        <p>Judaism is fundamentally based on a series of covenants – binding, mutual agreements – established between God and humanity, specifically with the Jewish people.</p>

                                    <li><em>Noahide Covenant (Gen 9):</em> Universal pact with all humanity after the Flood, establishing basic moral laws (Seven Laws of Noah).</li>
                                    <li><em>Abrahamic Covenant (Gen 12, 15, 17):</em> God promises Abraham descendants, land (Land of Israel), and divine protection; Abraham and descendants promise faith and obedience. Physical sign for males: Circumcision (<em>Brit Milah</em>). Basis of Jewish peoplehood.</li>
                                    <li><em>Mosaic Covenant (Sinai) (Ex 19-24, Deuteronomy):</em> God reveals the Torah (laws, teachings) to the Israelites through Moses at Mount Sinai. Israel accepts the obligation (mitzvot) to follow God's ways, becoming a 'kingdom of priests and a holy nation' (Ex 19:6), tasked with being a moral exemplar. Central covenant defining Jewish practice.</li>
                                    <li><em>Davidic Covenant (2 Sam 7):</em> God promises King David an eternal dynasty, from whom the future Messiah will descend.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Nature:</strong> A dynamic, enduring relationship involving mutual obligations. God offers guidance, protection, and purpose; the Jewish people commit to faithfulness, observance of mitzvot, and ethical living.</li>
                            <li><strong>Chosenness:</strong> The covenants imply a concept of 'chosenness' – not superiority, but selection for specific responsibilities and purpose (e.g., upholding the Torah, witnessing God in the world).</li>
                            <li><strong>Renewal:</strong> Covenants are seen as eternally relevant and have been reaffirmed throughout history (e.g., Joshua's covenant at Shechem, Josiah's reform, Ezra/Nehemiah's post-exilic renewal).</li>

                            <li><strong>Ongoing Revelation?:</strong> While direct prophecy ceased after the early Second Temple period, some view ongoing interpretation, mystical experience, or historical events as forms of continued divine communication or guidance. Liberal movements emphasize ongoing revelation through human reason and experience.</li>

                       <p>The act of studying Jewish sacred texts is not merely academic but a central religious obligation (mitzvah) and a primary form of worship and connection to God.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Supreme Importance:</strong> Considered one of the greatest mitzvot. The Mishnah (Peah 1:1) famously states that 'the study of Torah is equivalent to all other commandments combined' because it leads to their fulfillment. Pirkei Avot emphasizes continuous learning.</li>
                            <li><strong>Scope of Study:</strong> Encompasses a vast range of texts:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><em>Tanakh (Hebrew Bible):</em> Especially the Chumash (Pentateuch) with commentaries (e.g., Rashi).</li>
                                    <li><em>Mishnah & Talmud:</em> The core of rabbinic law and thought, requiring rigorous analysis.</li>
                                    <li><em>Halakha:</em> Codes of Jewish law (e.g., Mishneh Torah, Shulchan Arukh) and responsa literature.</li>
                                    <li><em>Midrash:</em> Homiletic and legal interpretations of scripture.</li>
                                    <li><em>Jewish Philosophy:</em> Works of thinkers from Saadia Gaon to modern times.</li>
                                    <li><em>Kabbalah & Hasidut:</em> Jewish mysticism and spirituality (often studied after foundational texts).</li>
                                    <li><em>Mussar:</em> Jewish ethical literature.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Methods & Practice:</strong> Lifelong pursuit is encouraged. Traditional methods include <em>Chevruta</em> (study with a partner, fostering debate) and attending lectures (<em>shiurim</em>). Communal study cycles like <em>Daf Yomi</em> (daily Talmud page) and <em>Mishnah Yomi</em> are popular. Traditionally male-focused, women's learning has expanded dramatically across movements.</li>
                            <li><strong>Goal:</strong> To understand God's will, learn how to live a proper Jewish life, connect with tradition, sharpen the mind, cultivate piety, and experience the intellectual joy of engaging with divine wisdom (study *lishma* - for its own sake).</li>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><em>'Love your neighbor as yourself'</em> (Lev 19:18) - considered a core principle by Rabbi Akiva.</li>
                                    <li><em>Pursuit of Justice:</em> 'Justice, justice shall you pursue' (<em>Tzedek, tzedek tirdof</em> - Deut 16:20).</li>
                                    <li><em>Imitatio Dei (Imitating God):</em> Striving to emulate God's attributes of mercy, compassion, and justice (e.g., 'Just as He is merciful, you be merciful' - Talmud).</li>

                            <li><strong>Tzedakah (צְדָקָה):</strong> Righteousness/Justice. Obligatory giving to support the needy. Not optional charity, but fulfilling a duty. Traditional guideline: 10-20% of income. Maimonides' 'Ladder of Tzedakah' ranks anonymous giving and helping someone become self-sufficient highest.</li>
                            <li><strong>Gemilut Chasadim (גְּמִילוּת חֲסָדִים):</strong> Acts of loving-kindness. Deeds performed out of compassion, without expectation of reward. Includes hospitality (<em>Hachnasat Orchim</em>), visiting the sick (<em>Bikur Cholim</em>), comforting mourners (<em>Nichum Aveilim</em>), providing for brides, burying the dead respectfully, etc. Considered higher than Tzedakah as it involves personal effort and benefits rich and poor alike.</li>
                            <li><strong>Other Key Ethics:</strong> Honesty in business, kindness to animals (<em>Tza'ar Ba'alei Chayim</em>), caring for the environment (<em>Bal Tashchit</em> - do not destroy), pursuit of peace (<em>Shalom</em>), redeeming captives (<em>Pidyon Shvuyim</em>).</li>

                        <p>A fundamental principle in Judaism is that humans possess <em>Bechirah Chofshit</em> – the freedom to choose between good and evil, right and wrong. This capacity makes humans morally responsible agents.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Source of Choice:</strong> Rabbinic thought posits two inclinations within each person:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><em>Yetzer HaTov (Good Inclination):</em> The impulse towards altruism, spirituality, fulfilling God's will.</li>
                                    <li><em>Yetzer HaRa (Evil/Selfish Inclination):</em> The impulse towards self-gratification, physical desires, ego. Not inherently evil, but needs to be channeled constructively (e.g., ambition, procreation); can lead to sin if unchecked.</li>
                                </ul>
                                Life is a constant struggle/balance between these inclinations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Moral Agency & Accountability:</strong> Because choice exists, individuals are accountable for their actions before God and the community. God provides the Torah as guidance, but the decision lies with the person. 'See, I have set before you today life and good, death and evil... therefore choose life, that you and your offspring may live' (Deut 30:15, 19).</li>
                            <li><strong>Divine Foreknowledge vs. Free Will:</strong> Jewish philosophy grapples with the paradox of God's omniscience and human free will. The dominant view (e.g., Maimonides) holds that God knows the outcome of choices, but does not predetermine them ('Everything is foreseen, yet freedom of choice is given' - Pirkei Avot 3:15).</li>
                            <li><strong>Teshuva (Repentance/Return):</strong> The existence of free will makes genuine repentance possible. Teshuva involves recognizing wrongdoing, regretting it, confessing, resolving not to repeat the act, and making amends if others were harmed. Yom Kippur is the culmination of a period focused on Teshuva.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reward & Punishment:</strong> Belief in divine justice implies that actions have consequences, either in this world or the World to Come (Olam Ha-Ba), though the exact mechanisms are debated.</li>

                            <li><strong>Achieving Holiness:</strong> Primarily through meticulous observance of the Mitzvot (commandments), both ritual and ethical. Halakha provides the structure for infusing daily life with sanctity.</li>

                                    <li><em>Places:</em> The Land of Israel is considered holy; Jerusalem holier; the Temple Mount (site of former Temples) the holiest. Synagogues possess sanctity.</li>
                                    <li><em>Time:</em> Shabbat and Festivals (Yamim Tovim) are designated as 'sacred time' (<em>Mikra'ei Kodesh</em>).</li>

                                    <li><em>Actions:</em> Performing mitzvot with proper intention (<em>kavanah</em>), engaging in prayer and Torah study, performing acts of kindness (<em>Gemilut Chasadim</em>).</li>
                                    <li><em>Relationships:</em> Marriage is called *Kiddushin* (sanctification).</li>

                            <li><strong>The Messiah (Mashiach - 'Anointed One'):</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><em>Nature:</em> A human being, a righteous and charismatic leader descended from King David. Possessing exceptional wisdom, piety, knowledge of Torah, and leadership skills. NOT divine, semi-divine, or a supernatural being. (This distinguishes Judaism sharply from Christianity).</li>
                                    <li><em>Role:</em> To gather the Jewish exiles back to the Land of Israel (<em>Kibbutz Galuyot</em>), restore Jewish sovereignty, rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem (traditional view), end oppression and war, and inspire humanity to recognize and worship the One God.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Messianic Era:</strong> A time of utopian conditions on Earth:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Universal peace: 'Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore' (Isaiah 2:4).</li>
                                    <li>Universal knowledge and acceptance of God.</li>
                                    <li>Harmonious existence between humans and nature.</li>
                                    <li>Abundance, end of suffering, disease, and hatred.</li>
                                    <li>Observance of Torah becomes natural/universal (interpretations vary).</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Resurrection (<em>Techiyat HaMetim</em>):</strong> The traditional belief in the future physical revival of the dead, often associated with the Messianic Era or the transition to the ultimate World to Come. Literal belief held in Orthodoxy; often interpreted spiritually/metaphorically in liberal movements.</li>
                            <li><strong>Olam Ha-Ba (הָעוֹלָם הַבָּא - The World to Come):</strong> Can refer complexly to: (1) The spiritual realm souls go to after death (Gan Eden/Paradise or Gehinnom/Purgatory concepts). (2) The perfected world of the Messianic Era on Earth. (3) The ultimate spiritual reality after the Resurrection. Represents final reward, justice, and eternal closeness to God.</li>
                            <li><strong>Impact & Interpretation:</strong> Provides profound hope, purpose to Jewish history/suffering, and motivation for ethical living (Tikkun Olam - actions to 'repair the world' and bring redemption closer). Daily prayers (esp. Amidah) express yearning for redemption. Emphasis and literalness vary: Orthodoxy awaits a personal Mashiach; Liberal Judaism often emphasizes working towards a Messianic *Age* through human effort, rather than awaiting a specific individual or supernatural intervention.</li>

                        <p>Prayer in Judaism is a multifaceted practice involving formal liturgy, spontaneous personal supplication, and mindful intention (<span class='toggle-term'><span class='en'>Kavanah</span><span class='he'>כַּוָּנָה</span></span>). It's seen as 'service of the heart' (<em>Avodah shebaLev</em>), a way to connect with God, express gratitude, make requests, and affirm core beliefs. In rabbinic thought, structured prayer replaced the Temple sacrificial system.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Structure & Times:</strong> Three daily services are mandated, corresponding to times of Temple offerings (and traditionally linked to Patriarchs):
                                <ul>
                                    <li><em>Shacharit:</em> Morning service (Abraham). Longest service, includes Shema and Amidah. Tallit & Tefillin worn on weekday mornings.</li>
                                    <li><em>Mincha:</em> Afternoon service (Isaac). Typically shorter, includes Ashrei (Psalm 145) and Amidah.</li>
                                    <li><em>Maariv (or Arvit):</em> Evening service (Jacob). Includes Shema and Amidah.</li>
                                    <li><em>Musaf:</em> Additional service on Shabbat, Festivals, and Rosh Chodesh, recalling the additional Temple offerings.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Key Liturgical Components:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><em>Shema Yisrael & Blessings:</em> Affirmation of God's unity, surrounded by blessings praising God for creation, revelation, and redemption.</li>
                                    <li><em>Amidah ('Standing' Prayer / Shemoneh Esrei):</em> Core of every service, recited silently while standing, then often repeated aloud by the leader (<em>Chazzan</em>). Contains 19 blessings (18 originally + 1 added; 7 on Shabbat/Festivals) covering praise, petitions (weekday), and thanksgiving.</li>
                                    <li><em>Kaddish:</em> Aramaic prayer praising God, recited at transitional points in service and by mourners.</li>
                                    <li><em>Psalms (Tehillim):</em> Integral part, especially in introductory sections (<em>Pesukei Dezimra</em>).</li>
                                    <li><em>Torah Reading:</em> Public reading from the Torah scroll on Mon, Thu, Sat, Festivals, Fasts, Rosh Chodesh.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Language & Setting:</strong> Traditional liturgy is primarily in Hebrew (with some Aramaic, e.g., Kaddish). Prayer can be individual but communal prayer is highly valued, requiring a <em>Minyan</em> (quorum of 10 Jewish adults - traditionally men; egalitarian movements include women) for certain prayers like Kaddish, Amidah repetition, and Torah reading. Performed facing Jerusalem.</li>
                            <li><strong>The Siddur (Prayer Book):</strong> Contains the standardized texts for daily and lifecycle prayers.</li>

                        <p>The system of Jewish dietary laws derived from the Torah (esp. Leviticus 11, Deuteronomy 14). 'Kashrut' comes from the Hebrew root 'Kasher' (כָּשֵׁר), meaning fit, proper, or acceptable. Observing Kashrut is a mitzvah often seen as promoting holiness, self-discipline, Jewish identity, and respect for life.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Permitted & Forbidden Foods:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><em>Mammals:</em> Must have fully split hooves AND chew their cud (ruminants). Permitted: Cows, sheep, goats, deer. Forbidden: Pigs, camels, rabbits, horses, predatory animals.</li>
                                    <li><em>Birds:</em> Torah lists forbidden birds (mostly predatory/scavengers); specific permitted birds based on tradition (chicken, turkey, duck, goose).</li>
                                    <li><em>Fish:</em> Must have both fins AND easily removable scales. Permitted: Salmon, tuna, carp, herring, cod. Forbidden: Shellfish (shrimp, lobster, crab, clams), catfish, shark, swordfish, eel.</li>
                                    <li><em>Insects:</em> Generally forbidden, except for a few specific locust species (rarely eaten today).</li>
                                    <li><em>Other:</em> Reptiles, amphibians forbidden.</li>

                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Ritual Slaughter (<em>Shechita</em>):</strong> Permitted mammals/birds must be slaughtered in a specific manner by a trained, certified, observant Jew (<em>shochet</em>). Involves a quick, deep, horizontal cut across the neck with a perfectly smooth, sharp blade, intended to be humane and drain blood quickly. Carcass must be inspected for defects (<em>bedikah</em>) that render it non-kosher (<em>treif</em>).</li>
                            <li><strong>Blood Prohibition:</strong> Consumption of blood is strictly forbidden. Meat/poultry must undergo a process of soaking, salting, and rinsing (<em>kashering</em>) or broiling to remove surface blood before cooking. (Liver must be broiled).</li>
                            <li><strong>Meat & Dairy Separation (<em>Basar b'Chalav</em>):</strong> Complete separation of meat/poultry from all dairy products (milk, cheese, butter). Based on the prohibition 'Do not cook a kid in its mother's milk' (Ex. 23:19 etc.), interpreted broadly by rabbis. Requires separate utensils, dishes, cookware, sinks, towels, preparation areas. Waiting periods required between eating meat and dairy (e.g., 1, 3, or 6 hours, depending on custom) and vice versa (shorter wait).</li>
                            <li><strong>Parve Foods:</strong> Foods that are neither meat nor dairy (e.g., fruits, vegetables, grains, eggs, fish, water) are considered neutral ('parve') and can be eaten with either meat or dairy (though fish and meat are often not cooked/served together by custom).</li>
                            <li><strong>Grape Products:</strong> Wine, grape juice, and vinegar require specific kosher certification (<em>stam yeinam</em> concern).</li>
                            <li><strong>Kosher Supervision (<em>Hechsher</em>):</strong> Processed foods, restaurants, and institutional kitchens require certification from a reliable rabbinic agency (identified by a symbol - *hechsher*) verifying ingredients, equipment, and processes meet kashrut standards.</li>
                            <li><strong>Observance Level:</strong> Varies widely, from strict adherence in Orthodoxy to partial or non-observance in liberal movements.</li>

                    <div class="collapse collapse-content" id="collapseText1">
                       <p>The most sacred object in Jewish ritual; the physical embodiment of the first five books of the Hebrew Bible (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy), known as the Written Torah.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Physical Creation:</strong> Meticulously handwritten by a specially trained scribe (<em>Sofer STaM</em> - expert in Scrolls, Tefillin, Mezuzot) using a quill (often turkey feather) and specific black ink (<em>Deyo</em>) on panels of specially prepared parchment (<em>Klaf</em>) from a kosher animal (usually cow). The script used is a specific Hebrew style called <em>Ktav Ashuri</em>. Contains 304,805 letters, written without vowels or punctuation. Any significant error, or writing letters out of order, can invalidate the entire scroll. Completion is a major communal celebration (<em>Siyum Sefer Torah</em>).</li>
                            <li><strong>Ritual Use & Reading:</strong> Housed in the Ark (<em>Aron Kodesh</em>) in the synagogue. Read publicly during prayer services on Shabbat mornings and afternoons, Monday and Thursday mornings, Festivals, Fast Days, and Rosh Chodesh. The reading follows a set cycle, typically completed annually (on Simchat Torah) or sometimes triennially. Individuals are called up for honors (<em>Aliyot</em>) to recite blessings before and after sections are read.</li>
                            <li><strong>Handling & Reverence:</strong> Treated with utmost respect. Never touched directly by hand when reading; a pointer, often ornate, called a <em>Yad</em> ('hand') is used to follow the text. Stored upright when possible. Often 'dressed' in elaborate coverings: a binder (<em>Wimpel/Gartel</em>), a mantle (<em>Me'il</em>), silver ornaments like finials (<em>Rimonim</em>) or a crown (<em>Keter</em>), and sometimes a breastplate (<em>Choshen</em>). It is customary to stand when the Torah is carried through the congregation, and many people kiss it (often by touching their prayer book or tallit to the scroll and then kissing that).

                        <p>Vast, complex corpora constituting the heart of Rabbinic Judaism, representing the written form of the Oral Torah and its continued development.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Mishnah (מִשְׁנָה - 'Repetition/Study'):</strong> Compiled by Rabbi Judah HaNasi (c. 200 CE). The first major written codification of Jewish oral traditions and laws, presenting legal rulings, debates, and principles of the Sages known as Tannaim (c. 10-220 CE). Written in concise Mishnaic Hebrew. Organized into Six Orders (<em>Sedarim</em>), each containing multiple Tractates (<em>Masechtot</em>): <em>Zera'im</em> (Agriculture), <em>Mo'ed</em> (Festivals), <em>Nashim</em> (Women/Family Law), <em>Nezikin</em> (Civil/Criminal Law), <em>Kodashim</em> (Temple Sacrifices), <em>Tohorot</em> (Ritual Purity).</li>
                            <li><strong>Gemara (גְּמָרָא - 'Completion/Learning'):</strong> Extensive analysis and elaboration of the Mishnah by later Sages known as Amoraim (c. 200-500 CE in Palestine, c. 200-600 CE in Babylonia). Written primarily in Aramaic (Jewish Babylonian Aramaic or Jewish Palestinian Aramaic). Records legal debates, derivations of laws from Scripture, philosophical discussions, ethical teachings, historical anecdotes, folklore (<em>Aggadah</em>). Known for its dialectical method and preservation of minority opinions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Talmud (תַּלְמוּד - 'Learning/Instruction'):</strong> The combination of the Mishnah and its corresponding Gemara. Two versions exist:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><em>Babylonian Talmud (Talmud Bavli):</em> Developed in Babylonian academies (Sura, Pumbedita, etc.), completed c. 500-600 CE. More extensive, intricate, and considered more authoritative in Halakha. The primary source for most subsequent Jewish law.</li>
                                    <li><em>Jerusalem Talmud (Talmud Yerushalmi / Palestinan Talmud):</em> Compiled in the Land of Israel, completed c. 400 CE. Shorter, more concise, less digressive. Important but less studied than the Bavli.</li>
                                </ul>
                                Standard printed editions (e.g., Vilna Shas) feature Mishnah/Gemara text surrounded by key commentaries like Rashi (essential explanation) and Tosafot (critical analysis by Franco-German scholars).</li>
                            <li><strong>Midrash (מִדְרָשׁ - 'Investigation/Exposition'):</strong> A method of rabbinic biblical interpretation that seeks deeper meaning beyond the literal text (<em>peshat</em>), and the collections compiling such interpretations.
                                <ul>
                                    <li><em>Midrash Halakha:</em> Derives or supports laws (Halakha) from biblical verses (e.g., Mekhilta on Exodus, Sifra on Leviticus, Sifrei on Numbers/Deuteronomy).</li>
                                    <li><em>Midrash Aggadah:</em> Explores non-legal aspects - ethics, theology, history, filling narrative gaps, character development - through homilies, parables, stories (e.g., Genesis Rabbah, Leviticus Rabbah, Pesikta Rabbati).</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These texts are not seen as static but as a dynamic record of ongoing interpretation and debate, forming the bedrock of traditional Jewish thought and practice.</p>

                         <p>The traditional enumeration of 613 specific commandments (singular: <em>Mitzvah</em> - מִצְוָה) found within the Written Torah (Pentateuch), serving as the foundational blueprint for Jewish law (Halakha) and ethical conduct.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Source & Numbering:</strong> The number 613, while not explicitly listed in the Torah itself, is a traditional figure cited in the Talmud (Makkot 23b), possibly based on the numerical value (gematria) of the word 'Torah' plus two (representing the first two commandments heard directly from God) or other derivations. Various medieval authorities compiled lists, with Maimonides' (*Sefer HaMitzvot*) being the most famous and influential.</li>
                            <li><strong>Structure & Categories:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>248 Positive Commands ('Thou shalt...'):</strong> Actions one is obligated to perform (<em>Mitzvot Aseh</em>). Tradition links this number to the bones/major organs recognized by ancient sages in the human body, suggesting mitzvot permeate one's entire being.</li>
                                    <li><strong>365 Negative Commands ('Thou shalt not...'):</strong> Actions one must refrain from performing (<em>Mitzvot Lo Ta'aseh</em>). Tradition links this to the days in the solar year, suggesting constant vigilance is required.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Functional Categories:</strong> Often grouped as duties *bein adam laMakom* (between a person and God - e.g., prayer, Shabbat, Kashrut, ritual purity) and duties *bein adam l'chaveiro* (between a person and their fellow - e.g., justice, charity, honesty, ethical treatment). Some mitzvot span both categories.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Scope & Applicability:</strong> The mitzvot cover a vast range of life areas: worship, ritual, agriculture (in Israel), justice, commerce, family life, diet, clothing, speech, thought/belief. Many mitzvot are contingent on specific circumstances (e.g., related to the Temple, Priesthood, Kingship, living in the Land of Israel) and are not fully practicable today. Rabbinic law determines which mitzvot remain obligatory and how they are observed in contemporary contexts.</li>
                            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Viewed as divine guidance for living a meaningful, ethical, and holy life. Observance aims to refine character, build a just society, maintain Jewish identity, sanctify the mundane, demonstrate obedience and love for God, and foster a closer relationship with the Divine.</li>
                            <li><strong>Varying Emphasis:</strong> While Orthodoxy emphasizes observance of all applicable mitzvot as interpreted by Halakha, Conservative Judaism allows for more evolution, and Reform Judaism prioritizes ethical mitzvot while viewing ritual mitzvot as matters of informed individual choice.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Modern Judaism encompasses several major movements or denominations, largely shaped by diverse responses to the challenges and opportunities of modernity (Enlightenment, Emancipation, secularism) starting in 19th-century Europe. They differ primarily on the nature and authority of revelation (Torah) and Jewish Law (Halakha).</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Orthodox Judaism:</strong> The most traditional stream. Believes the Torah (both Written and Oral) is the literal, divine word of God, revealed at Sinai, and that Halakha derived from it is binding and immutable (though application evolves).
                                <ul><li><em>Haredi ('Trembling'/Ultra-Orthodox):</em> Prioritizes intense Torah study and strict adherence to Halakha, often maintaining separation from secular society to preserve tradition. Includes diverse subgroups: <em>Hasidic</em> communities (emphasizing spirituality, joy, mystical connection, led by dynastic Rebbes, e.g., Chabad, Satmar, Ger) and <em>Non-Hasidic ('Litvish'/'Yeshivish')</em> communities (emphasizing rigorous Talmudic study).</li><li><em>Modern Orthodox (or Centrist Orthodox):</em> Seeks to fully integrate strict Halakhic observance with active engagement in the modern, secular world (university education, professions, arts). Often strongly Zionist.</li></ul></li>
                            <li><strong>Conservative Judaism (Masorti outside North America):</strong> Views Torah as divinely inspired and Halakha as binding, but also believes law has historically developed and can evolve to meet contemporary needs, guided by scholarly rabbinic interpretation (within the framework of tradition). Seeks a middle ground between Orthodoxy and Reform. Traditionally affirmed matrilineal descent, now fully egalitarian in ritual roles and leadership.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reform Judaism (Liberal/Progressive outside North America):</strong> Originating in Germany, it views the Torah as divinely inspired but written by humans, reflecting ancient understandings. Emphasizes the ethical core of Judaism (prophetic message) over ritual observance. Views Halakha as non-binding guidance, prioritizing individual autonomy and informed choice in religious practice. Stresses adaptation to modern culture. Pioneered liturgical changes (vernacular prayer, mixed seating), egalitarianism, and accepts patrilineal descent (if child raised Jewish).</li>
                            <li><strong>Reconstructionist Judaism:</strong> Founded by Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan (originally Conservative). Views Judaism as an evolving religious civilization, encompassing culture, ethics, history, and art, not just theology/law. God concepts can vary (often non-supernatural). Halakha considered valuable 'folkways' reflecting community values, but not divinely mandated law. Emphasizes democratic process in community decisions, deep commitment to egalitarianism and social justice.</li>
                            <li><strong>Other Approaches:</strong> <em>Jewish Renewal</em> (focuses on mysticism, spirituality, neo-Hasidism, often blending traditions); <em>Secular Humanistic Judaism</em> (celebrates Jewish culture, history, ethics without theistic belief or reliance on supernatural).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These movements represent a spectrum, differing significantly on conversion standards, liturgical practices, levels of observance, views on LGBTQ+ inclusion, intermarriage, and the role of women.</p>

                        <p>Beyond religious movements (which often include members from various backgrounds), the Jewish people comprise distinct ethnic and cultural subgroups shaped by centuries of geographic dispersion and interaction with surrounding cultures. These 'Edot' (communities) influence customs, pronunciation of Hebrew, liturgy (<em>Nusach</em>), music, food, and sometimes specific Halakhic interpretations.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Ashkenazi Jews:</strong> Descendants of communities that initially settled in the Rhine Valley (Franco-Germany) around the 1st millennium CE, later migrating eastward to Poland, Lithuania, Russia, etc., due to persecution. Historically spoke Yiddish (a High German dialect with Hebrew/Aramaic/Slavic elements). Make up the majority of Jews in North America and formerly in Europe pre-Holocaust. Associated foods: gefilte fish, kugel, challah, matzah ball soup, cholent. Dominant liturgical rite: *Nusach Ashkenaz*.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sephardi Jews:</strong> Descendants of communities from the Iberian Peninsula (Spain - *Sefarad* - and Portugal). Flourished under Muslim rule ('Golden Age'), then expelled in 1492 (Spain) and 1497 (Portugal). Migrated to North Africa, the Ottoman Empire (Balkans, Turkey, Middle East), Italy, Netherlands, and the Americas. Historically spoke Ladino/Judeo-Spanish (Castilian Spanish base with Hebrew/Aramaic/Arabic/Turkish elements). Known for distinct musical traditions, literature, and Mediterranean/Middle Eastern influenced cuisine. Liturgical rite: *Nusach Sepharad/Edot HaMizrach* (complex history, different from Hasidic Nusach Sefard).</li>
                            <li><strong>Mizrahi Jews ('Eastern'):</strong> Descendants of ancient Jewish communities that remained in or historically lived throughout the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, predating the Ashkenazi/Sephardi distinction. Includes Jews from Iraq (Babylonia), Iran (Persia), Yemen, Syria, Egypt, Morocco, etc. Very diverse subgroups with distinct histories, customs, and languages (various Judeo-Arabic dialects, Judeo-Persian, etc.). Often grouped with Sephardim post-1492 due to shared liturgical rites and recent historical overlaps, especially after mass emigration to Israel post-1948, but possess unique ancient roots.</li>
                            <li><strong>Other Distinct Groups:</strong> Smaller but historically significant communities include: <em>Beta Israel</em> (Ethiopian Jews), <em>Bene Israel</em> & <em>Cochin Jews</em> (Indian Jews), <em>Italkim</em> (Italian Jews with unique ancient rite), <em>Romaniote Jews</em> (Greek-speaking Jews with ancient roots in Byzantine Empire), Bukharan Jews (Central Asia), Georgian Jews, etc.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These identities are complex and often overlap; intermarriage between groups is common today, especially in Israel and the Diaspora.</p>

                            <li><strong>Divided Monarchy (c. 930-586 BCE):</strong> Kingdom splits into Northern Kingdom (Israel - conquered by Assyria c. 722 BCE, leading to 'Ten Lost Tribes') and Southern Kingdom (Judah). Major literary prophets active (Isaiah, Jeremiah, etc.).</li>
                            <li><strong>Babylonian Exile (586-538 BCE):</strong> Nebuchadnezzar II destroys First Temple, exiles Judean leadership to Babylonia. Period of reflection, development of synagogue precursors, editing of texts (Ezekiel, Lamentations).</li>
                            <li><strong>Second Temple Period (538 BCE - 70 CE):</strong> Return under Persian King Cyrus; Temple rebuilt (modestly at first). Rule by Persians, then Hellenistic Greeks (Ptolemies/Seleucids). Hasmonean Revolt (Maccabees) against Antiochus IV's forced Hellenization (c. 167 BCE) leads to brief independence (origin of Hanukkah). Roman conquest (63 BCE). Period of sectarianism (Pharisees, Sadducees, Essenes, Zealots). Ministry of Jesus.

                        <p>With the Temple destroyed, Judaism underwent a profound transformation, shifting authority to rabbis and texts, enabling survival and flourishing in diaspora.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Development of Rabbinic Judaism (c. 70-600 CE):</strong> Sages (Tannaim, then Amoraim) based initially in Yavneh, later in Galilee and Babylonia, reinterpret Judaism for a Temple-less reality. Focus shifts from sacrifice to prayer (standardized liturgy - Siddur), Torah study, and mitzvot observance in daily life. Synagogue (Beit Knesset) becomes central communal institution. Oral Law systematically compiled: Mishnah (c. 200 CE), Talmuds (Jerusalem c. 400 CE, Babylonian c. 500-600 CE). Establishment of Halakha as guiding principle.</li>
                            <li><strong>Geonic Period (c. 600-1050 CE):</strong> Centers of Jewish learning and authority in Babylonia (Sura, Pumbedita) led by Geonim ('Excellencies'). They interpret Talmud, issue legal rulings (responsa) guiding dispersed communities, develop prayer book further. Masoretes in Tiberias finalize Hebrew Bible text (vowels, cantillation). Karaite movement emerges (rejecting Oral Law).</li>
                            <li><strong>Medieval Period (c. 1000-1500 CE):</strong> Jewish life diversifies geographically and culturally.
                                <ul>
                                    <li><em>Spain (Al-Andalus):</em> 'Golden Age' under relatively tolerant Muslim rule. Flourishing of Hebrew poetry (Halevi, Ibn Gabirol), philosophy (Maimonides, Ibn Ezra), science, grammar. Ends with increasing persecution (Almohads) and Christian Reconquista, culminating in expulsion from Spain (1492) and Portugal (1497).</li>
                                    <li><em>Franco-Germany (Ashkenaz):</em> Development of distinct Ashkenazi culture. Flourishing of Biblical/Talmudic commentary (Rashi, Tosafists). Mystical movements (Hasidei Ashkenaz). Severe persecution during Crusades (1096 onwards), blood libels, host desecration accusations, Black Death scapegoating, expulsions (England 1290, France 1306/1394).</li>
                                    <li><em>Mysticism (Kabbalah):</em> Emerges, particularly in Provence and Spain (e.g., the Zohar compiled by Moses de Leon c. 13th C).</li>
                                    <li><em>Codification of Law:</em> Major legal codes produced to systematize Halakha (Maimonides' *Mishneh Torah* - 12th C; Jacob ben Asher's *Arba'ah Turim* - 14th C; Joseph Karo's *Shulchan Arukh* - 16th C, becomes dominant code, esp. with Ashkenazi glosses of Moses Isserles).</li>

                            <li><strong>Early Modern Period (c. 1500-1750):</strong> Sephardic diaspora spreads post-expulsion. Rise of Ottoman Jewry. Lurianic Kabbalah flourishes in Safed. Shabbetai Zevi messianic movement and its collapse (1666). Emergence of Hasidism in Eastern Europe (Baal Shem Tov, c. 1700s), emphasizing joy, piety, mysticism for the masses; opposed by Mitnagdim (led by Vilna Gaon).</li>
                            <li><strong>Enlightenment & Emancipation (c. 1750-1900):</strong> Jewish Enlightenment (Haskalah, led by figures like Moses Mendelssohn) promotes secular education, cultural integration, Hebrew language revival. Gradual (often contested) granting of civil rights (emancipation) in Western/Central Europe leads to debates on Jewish identity vs. national citizenship. Rise of modern, racial Antisemitism.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rise of Modern Movements (19th C):</strong> Divergent responses to modernity lead to emergence of Reform Judaism (Germany, later US - adapting tradition), Orthodoxy (as self-conscious reaction defending tradition), Positive-Historical School (forerunner of Conservative Judaism).</li>
                            <li><strong>Mass Migrations (Late 19th - Early 20th C):</strong> Pogroms and poverty in Russian Empire (Pale of Settlement) spur mass emigration, primarily to the United States, but also to Western Europe, South America, Palestine. Transforms Jewish demographics and cultures. Development of Yiddish culture, labor movement.</li>
                            <li><strong>Zionism (Late 19th C - Present):</strong> Modern political movement advocating Jewish self-determination and the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine (Eretz Yisrael), spurred by rising nationalism and antisemitism (Theodor Herzl's *The Jewish State*, 1896). Leads to waves of immigration (Aliyot) and development of the Yishuv (pre-state Jewish community).</li>
                            <li><strong>The Holocaust (Shoah) (1933-1945):</strong> Systematic, state-sponsored persecution and genocide of approximately six million European Jews by Nazi Germany and its collaborators. Decimates Ashkenazi Jewry, profoundly impacts Jewish theology, identity, memory, and strengthens impetus for statehood.</li>
                            <li><strong>Establishment of Israel (1948):</strong> Creation of the modern State of Israel following UN partition plan and War of Independence. Mass immigration from post-Holocaust Europe and Arab/Muslim countries (Mizrahi Jews). Ongoing Arab-Israeli conflict shapes Israeli society and Diaspora relations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Contemporary Life (Post-1948):</strong> Major population centers in Israel and North America (esp. US). Continued diversity of religious practice. Challenges include assimilation, intermarriage rates, navigating relationship between Israel and Diaspora, internal Israeli social/religious tensions, resurgent antisemitism globally. Growth of Orthodoxy, especially Haredi communities.</li>

                        <p>Jewish philosophy involves the application of rational inquiry and philosophical methods to explore and articulate Jewish beliefs, ethics, and experiences. It often engages in dialogue with dominant non-Jewish philosophical traditions of the era, seeking synthesis, critique, or clarification of Jewish distinctiveness.</p>
                        <p><strong>Key Themes:</strong> Relationship between Reason and Revelation, Nature and Attributes of God, Creation, Free Will vs. Determinism, Problem of Evil, Nature of Prophecy, Basis of Ethics, Jewish Chosenness, Meaning of Exile and Redemption, Interpretation of Scripture.</p>
                        <p><strong>Key Figures (Chronological):</strong></p>
                        <ul>

                            <li><strong>Saadia Gaon (882–942):</strong> Head of Babylonian academy (Gaon). Rationalist, influenced by Islamic Kalam philosophy. Wrote *Emunot v'Deot* (Book of Beliefs and Opinions), defending Rabbinic Judaism and demonstrating its compatibility with reason against challenges (e.g., Karaites).</li>
                            <li><strong>Solomon Ibn Gabirol (c. 1021–c. 1058):</strong> Spanish Neoplatonist poet-philosopher. Wrote *Fons Vitae* (Fountain of Life).</li>
                            <li><strong>Rashi (Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki) (1040–1105):</strong> French rabbi and preeminent commentator on the Torah and Talmud. His works clarified the plain meaning (*peshat*) of texts, making them accessible to scholars and laypeople alike. Rashi's commentaries became foundational in Jewish study, influencing both Jewish and Christian exegesis. His Torah commentary was the first dated Hebrew printed book (1475).</li>
                            <li><strong>Judah Halevi (c. 1075–1141):</strong> Spanish poet and philosopher. Wrote *Kuzari*, an imagined dialogue defending Judaism. Emphasized the unique historical experience of revelation at Sinai and the particularity of Jewish connection to God and Land of Israel, contrasting it with universal philosophical proofs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Moses Maimonides (Rambam) (1138–1204):</strong> Preeminent medieval Jewish philosopher and legalist (born Spain, lived Egypt). Masterfully synthesized Aristotelian philosophy with Jewish tradition in *The Guide for the Perplexed* (aimed at intellectuals struggling with apparent contradictions). Codified Jewish law (*Mishneh Torah*). Formulated influential *13 Principles of Faith*. His work sparked major controversies.</li>
                            <li><strong>Gersonides (Levi ben Gershom / Ralbag) (1288–1344):</strong> French Aristotelian philosopher, astronomer, Talmudist. Held more radical views than Maimonides on issues like divine knowledge of particulars and creation, prioritizing philosophical coherence.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hasdai Crescas (c. 1340–1410):</strong> Spanish philosopher. Critiqued Aristotelian physics and metaphysics, defending divine omnipotence and free will, influencing later thinkers like Spinoza.</li>
                            <li><strong>Baruch Spinoza (1632–1677):</strong> Dutch philosopher of Sephardic origin, excommunicated for his pantheistic views and critique of traditional religion. Highly influential in Western philosophy but outside the Jewish mainstream.</li>
                            <li><strong>Moses Mendelssohn (1729–1786):</strong> German philosopher, central figure of Haskalah (Jewish Enlightenment). Argued in *Jerusalem* that Judaism is a religion of reason and revealed law (not dogma), compatible with Enlightenment values. Advocated for Jewish civil rights and integration.</li>
                            <li><strong>Baal Shem Tov (Rabbi Israel ben Eliezer) (c. 1700–1760):</strong> Eastern European Jewish mystic and founder of Hasidic Judaism. Emphasized joyful worship, heartfelt prayer, and the accessibility of the divine to all, countering the era's elitist and rationalist trends. His teachings highlighted *devekut* (cleaving to God), the sanctity of everyday life, and the spiritual leadership of the *tzadik*. His movement revitalized Jewish spirituality and continues to influence Hasidic communities today.</li>
                            <li><strong>Modern Thinkers (20th C - Selected):</strong> Diverse responses to modernity, existentialism, Holocaust.
                                <ul>
                                    <li><em>Hermann Cohen (Neo-Kantian ethics), Martin Buber (I-Thou dialogue, existentialism), Franz Rosenzweig (*Star of Redemption*, new thinking), Abraham Joshua Heschel (theology of divine pathos, awe, social action), Joseph B.

                         <p>Jewish eschatology centers on the belief in a future, ultimate redemption (<span class='toggle-term'><span class='en'>Geulah</span><span class='he'>גְּאוּלָּה</span></span>), ushering in a perfected world known as the Messianic Era, and culminating in the World to Come (<span class='toggle-term'><span class='en'>Olam Ha-Ba</span><span class='he'>הָעוֹלָם הַבָּא</span></span>). This provides a linear view of history moving towards a divinely promised goal.</p>
                        <ul><li><strong>The Messiah (<em>Mashiach</em> - 'Anointed One'):</strong>
                            <ul><li><em>Traditional View:</em> A future human king, descended from King David, endowed with exceptional wisdom, piety, and leadership. He will orchestrate the redemption process. Key tasks: Ingathering of Jewish exiles (<em>Kibbutz Galuyot</em>) to the Land of Israel, restoring Jewish sovereignty and potentially the Davidic monarchy, rebuilding the Temple (<em>Beit HaMikdash</em>) in Jerusalem, bringing universal peace, and inspiring all humanity to recognize and worship the One God.</li><li><em>Nature:</em> Fully human, not divine or semi-divine. Judaism rejects the Christian identification of Jesus as the Messiah, as he did not fulfill these traditional criteria.</li><li><em>Timing:</em> Believed to come when the world is either sufficiently worthy or sufficiently desperate, or at a predetermined time. Actions (mitzvot, repentance) can potentially hasten arrival.</li></ul></li>
                        <li><strong>The Messianic Era:</strong> A period of unprecedented global transformation on Earth.
                            <ul><li>Characteristics: Universal peace and harmony ('Nation shall not lift up sword against nation...' - Isaiah 2:4), end of war, hatred, famine, suffering. Universal knowledge and acceptance of God. Righteousness, justice, and kindness prevail. Some traditions describe technological advancement and material abundance, freeing humanity for spiritual pursuits (Torah study). Nature itself may be perfected.</li></ul></li>
                        <li><strong>Resurrection of the Dead (<em>Techiyat HaMetim</em>):</strong> The traditional belief (13th Principle of Maimonides) that at some point during/after the Messianic Era, the dead will be brought back to life (physically or spiritually, interpretations vary). Affirms the value of the body and the ultimate triumph of life.</li>
                        <li><strong>Olam Ha-Ba (The World to Come):</strong> A term with multiple related meanings:
                            <ul><li>The spiritual afterlife experienced by the soul immediately after death (related to Gan Eden/Paradise or Gehinnom/Purgatory concepts).</li><li>The perfected reality of the Messianic Era on Earth.</li><li>The ultimate, perhaps purely spiritual, state of existence after the Resurrection, representing eternal closeness to God.</li></ul></li>
                        <li><strong>Interpretation & Significance:</strong> This vision provides hope, gives meaning to suffering and exile, anchors ethical behavior (Tikkun Olam - actions to 'repair the world' and bring redemption closer), and fuels perseverance. Daily prayers (esp. Amidah) petition for redemption. Literalism vs. Metaphor: Orthodox Judaism maintains belief in a personal Messiah and literal fulfillment. Liberal Judaism often interprets the Messianic hope metaphorically as a human-driven process towards an era of universal peace and justice, achieved through social action and ethical progress, rather than awaiting a specific individual or supernatural intervention.</li></ul>
