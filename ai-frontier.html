         <li>
          <strong>
           Transition to "Capped-Profit":
          </strong>
          In 2019, OpenAI LP was formed as a capped-profit subsidiary to raise the substantial capital needed for compute-intensive research, while the non-profit OpenAI, Inc. remains the overall governing body with its mission as primary. [1, 12]

         Core Tenets
        </h6>
        <ul>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Beneficial AGI:
          </strong>
          The primary mission is to ensure that AGI, defined as highly autonomous systems outperforming humans at most economically valuable work, benefits all of humanity. [1]
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Safety Research &amp; Preparedness:
          </strong>
          Significant investment in AI safety research to mitigate risks from powerful AI. [13] They developed a "Preparedness Framework" to assess and manage catastrophic risks associated with frontier AI models.
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Long-term Perspective:
          </strong>
          Acknowledges that AGI development is a long and challenging endeavor requiring sustained research efforts.
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Iterative Deployment:
          </strong>
          Believes in deploying increasingly capable AI systems to learn from real-world applications, allowing society to adapt and for safety measures to be refined based on empirical evidence.
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Evolving Openness:
          </strong>
          While initially having a strong open-source ethos, OpenAI has become more selective about releasing its most powerful models, citing safety and competitive reasons. However, it continues to publish research and release some models and tools (e.g., on

        </h6>
        <ul>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Core Mission:
          </strong>
          The development of AGI is central to OpenAI's charter. [1] They define AGI as "highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work." [1]
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Safety as a Priority:
          </strong>
          AGI development is pursued with a strong emphasis on alignment with human values and intentions. [13] OpenAI has a "Preparedness Framework" to evaluate and mitigate catastrophic risks from advanced AI.
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Path to AGI:
          </strong>
          Primarily involves scaling current deep learning architectures (like Transformers), complemented by research into new architectures, algorithms, and continuous safety improvements. Iterative deployment of increasingly capable systems is a key part of this strategy. [13]
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           ASI Considerations:
          </strong>
          OpenAI acknowledges the potential for Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) beyond AGI and the profound societal implications, stressing the need for careful governance and global cooperation.

        <ul>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Goal of Human-Level Intelligence:
          </strong>
          Meta AI's long-term vision includes creating AI systems with cognitive capabilities comparable to humans in areas like learning, reasoning, perception, and interaction with the world.
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Yann LeCun's Vision for AGI:
          </strong>
          LeCun, a key figure at Meta AI, advocates for AI architectures that go beyond current auto-regressive LLMs. He proposes systems capable of learning "world models" (internal representations of how the world works), enabling them to predict, reason, and plan effectively. This includes research into concepts like Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) and more modular, hierarchical AI systems.
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Openness as a Pathway to Safe AGI:
          </strong>
          Meta AI believes that open development, collaboration, and community scrutiny are essential for building AGI that is safe, well-understood, broadly beneficial, and aligned with human values.
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Embodied AI and Robotics:
          </strong>
          Research into AI systems that can learn and interact within physical environments (e.g., robotics, AR/VR interactions) is seen as important for developing more grounded and comprehensive intelligence.
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Building Blocks for AGI:
          </strong>
          Current large-scale models and research into areas like self-supervised learning, reasoning, and multimodal understanding are considered foundational steps toward more general intelligence.

         <li>
          <strong>
           Commitment to Openness:
          </strong>
          A key differentiator. Mistral AI releases many of its powerful models with open weights under licenses like Apache 2.0, allowing broad use, modification, and scrutiny by the global research and developer community. [3, 7, 21, 23] This contrasts with the more closed approach of some competitors. [9]
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Computational Efficiency:
          </strong>
          Develops models that are not only powerful but also optimized for performance, aiming for better inference speed, lower computational costs, and smaller memory footprints. This is often achieved through innovative architectures like sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). [21, 23]
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Pragmatic Dual Approach:
          </strong>
          Balances its open-source contributions with optimized commercial models and API offerings (La Plateforme) for enterprise use, providing both freely accessible tools and supported enterprise-grade solutions. [22]

         <li>
          <strong>
           Democratizing AI:

         <li>
          <strong>
           Building Foundational Capabilities:
          </strong>
          The immediate focus is on creating highly capable and general-purpose foundational models that can serve a wide array of applications and industries.
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Efficiency as a Driver for Scale:
          </strong>
          Mistral believes that more efficient model architectures (like their use of Mixture-of-Experts) are crucial for sustainably scaling AI capabilities and making advanced models more accessible. [23]
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Openness for Safety and Broader Understanding:
          </strong>
          By releasing many models openly, Mistral AI aims to enable the global community to research their capabilities, limitations, and safety aspects. This collaborative approach is seen as vital for ensuring AI develops responsibly. [3, 7, 23, 24]
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Pragmatic and Value-Oriented Development:
          </strong>
          While the long-term trajectory of AI points towards increasingly general intelligence, Mistral's public messaging and product development prioritize delivering tangible value with existing and near-term models. Explicit AGI timelines are not a central part of their communication, focusing instead on democratizing current advanced AI. [5]
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Future Ambitions:
          </strong>
          Reports suggest plans to train models with hundreds of billions and potentially trillion parameters, aiming to achieve or surpass human-level accuracy in various NLP tasks. [5]
