# SEO planning — cheatsheets.davidveksler.com

Placeholder working doc for ongoing SEO strategy. Not a spec for a single cheatsheet (see
`TODO/README.md` for that) — this is the durable planning surface for search-visibility work
across the whole site. Update in place; don't delete after one pass.

Data source: Google Search Console property `https://cheatsheets.davidveksler.com/`
(MCP tool `search-console`). Re-pull before trusting numbers below more than a few weeks old —
this doc is a snapshot, not a live dashboard.

## Ground rule: judge per site goal, not site-wide

Per memory `cheatsheets-site-goals`, pages serve four different goals (personal study, personal
brand/portfolio, agentic-automation case study, political advocacy). Only goal-3 (case study —
"organic traffic proves the approach works") and goal-4 (advocacy — reach/persuasion) pages
should be judged on search performance. Never recommend pruning or deprioritizing a page for low
search demand without first checking which goal it serves.

### Top queries by clicks

| Query | Clicks | Impressions | CTR | Avg. position |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| frontier ai companies | 7 | 266 | 2.6% | 5.5 |
| baofeng uv-5r programming cheat sheet | 6 | 237 | 2.5% | 7.5 |
| frontier model providers | 5 | 81 | 6.2% | 3.1 |
| what are the current frontier ai models | 5 | 91 | 5.5% | 6.6 |
| list of frontier ai models | 4 | 156 | 2.6% | 4.7 |

The "frontier ai" query family (companies/models/labs/providers) dominates clicks — several
variants already rank position 3-8. `ai-frontier.html` is the site's clear traffic driver.

### Striking-distance opportunities (high impressions, low CTR, position 7-20)

These pages get real search visibility but a poor click-through rate relative to it — the
highest-leverage targets for on-page/title/meta work rather than new content:

- **ai-frontier.html** — 42,978 impressions, 0.29% CTR, position 10.2. Biggest single lever on
  the site: even a modest CTR lift at this impression volume outweighs most new-page work.
- **orbital-rockets-comparison.html** — 11,713 impressions, 0.38% CTR, position 10.4.
- **martial-arts-cheatsheet.html** — 6,510 impressions, 0.15% CTR, position 7.0. Position is
  already good; title/snippet is likely the problem, not ranking.
- **google-ai-studio-guide.html** — 2,337 impressions, 0.43% CTR, position 10.7.
- **compression-algorithms.html** — 1,545 impressions, 0.32% CTR, position 18.0.
- **tesla-products.html** — 1,961 impressions, 0.31% CTR, position 12.8.

## Open questions / next steps

- [ ] Diagnose why `ai-frontier.html` CTR is so low despite good position — check title tag,
  meta description, and SERP snippet against top query intent ("frontier ai companies",
  "list of frontier ai models").
- [ ] Decide whether to pull a longer window (90/180 days) for trend direction, not just a
  28-day snapshot.
- [ ] Check `list_sitemaps` / coverage status for indexing gaps (pages with zero impressions
  that should have some).
- [ ] Cross-reference striking-distance pages against `TODO/CHEATSHEET-AUDIT.md` metadata
  checks (title/description/JSON-LD) before assuming the fix is content depth vs. metadata.
- [ ] Revisit `SEO_PROMPT.txt` footer cross-linking procedure — confirm striking-distance pages
  are well-linked from higher-traffic pages in their cluster.
