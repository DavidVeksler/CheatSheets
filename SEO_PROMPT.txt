SEO Cross-Linking Instructions for Cheatsheet HTML Pages

OBJECTIVE:
Create href links between related cheatsheet HTML pages to improve SEO and discovery by establishing internal link structure that helps users find complementary content.

PROCESS:

1. ANALYZE & GROUP PAGES
   - Scan all HTML filenames in the root directory
   - Group pages by related subject categories (e.g., Bitcoin/crypto, martial arts, AI/tech, philosophy/religion, programming/development)
   - Identify 3-6 pages per logical grouping based on content themes

2. READ & UNDERSTAND CONTENT
   - Read each set of related pages to understand their content and structure
   - Identify the best placement for cross-links (typically footer sections)
   - Look for existing link patterns and styling to maintain consistency

3. ADD CROSS-LINKS
   - Insert links in footer or resource sections using Bootstrap styling
   - Use relative URLs (e.g., "page.html") not absolute URLs
   - Include appropriate Bootstrap icons for visual appeal
   - Add descriptive title attributes for accessibility
   - Use consistent link attributes: rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"

4. LINK PLACEMENT PATTERN
   Add a new section above existing footer links:
   ```html
   <div class="mb-3">
    <strong>Related [Category Name]:</strong><br>
    <a class="mx-2" href="related-page.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Descriptive Title">
     <i class="bi bi-[appropriate-icon]"></i>
     Short Link Text
    </a>
    <!-- Additional related links -->
   </div>
   ```

5. ICON SUGGESTIONS
   - Bitcoin/Crypto: bi-currency-bitcoin, bi-wallet, bi-shield-check
   - Martial Arts: bi-person-arms-up, bi-trophy, bi-award
   - AI/Tech: bi-cpu-fill, bi-shield-exclamation, bi-diagram-3-fill, bi-brain

   - Programming: bi-git, bi-hash, bi-braces, bi-file-code, bi-database, bi-building

6. COMMIT STRATEGY
   - Work on one category group at a time
   - Git commit each completed category with descriptive commit message
   - Include all modified files in each category commit
   - Use consistent commit message format with ðŸ¤– Generated with Claude Code footer

7. QUALITY STANDARDS
   - Ensure links are bidirectional (if A links to B, B should link to A)
   - Maintain consistent styling with existing Bootstrap classes
   - Test that all links work and point to existing files
   - Keep link text concise but descriptive
   - Ensure links don't disrupt main content flow
