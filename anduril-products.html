                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Anduril's Edge:</strong> The software-first philosophy is embodied in Lattice OS's modular
                    microservices architecture, which allows for continuous iteration and rapid integration of new
                    hardware (sensors, platforms, effectors) and software capabilities (AI models, C2 features) in
                    weeks, not years. This "software-defined hardware" approach ensures systems evolve at the speed of
                    relevance, countering emerging threats effectively.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Multi-Domain Connectivity:</strong> Seamlessly links air assets (e.g., Altius providing BLOS
                    comms relay, Ghost conducting ISR), ground systems (e.g., Sentry Towers sharing sensor data, Menace
                    C2 nodes providing distributed command posts), and maritime platforms (e.g., Dive AUVs surfaced for

                    clutter rejection algorithms) minimizes data transmission bandwidth requirements (only sending
                    tracks and metadata, not raw video unless requested) and enables autonomous functions even with
                    intermittent or no C2 links. Facilitates rapid AI model updates and algorithm refinement in the
                    field.

                    <strong>Anduril's Edge:</strong> CPI technology represents a fundamental shift from traditional
                    electro-optical sensor architectures (which typically digitize raw data then send it to a separate,
                    power-hungry processor). Iris enables significantly faster reaction times, superior autonomous
                    capabilities, enhanced performance in dense and cluttered environments, and a reduced processing
                    burden on host platforms, directly embodying Anduril's philosophy of AI-driven mission systems.

                <h6>Key Features & Variants:</h6>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Variant Family:</strong> Includes Copperhead-100 (smaller, ~6-inch/15cm diameter -
                    estimated, for deployment from smaller UUVs/USVs or by hand) and Copperhead-500 (larger,
                    ~12.75-inch/32.4cm diameter, standard lightweight torpedo size - estimated, for deployment from
                    larger platforms). Both sizes available in ISR (Copperhead) and munition (Copperhead-M)
                    configurations.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Speed & Propulsion:</strong> Capable of high speeds (reported >30 kts, potentially up to
                    40-50 kts in burst mode for intercept - estimated) using advanced, quiet electric propulsion systems
                    (e.g., direct drive motor, ducted propulsor or pump-jet for enhanced efficiency and reduced
                    cavitation at high speeds) and high-energy-density Lithium-ion batteries. Enables rapid transit,
                    maneuverability for interception, or quick ISR dashes.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Deployment & Modularity:</strong> Designed for deployment from a wide array of host
                    platforms, including larger AUVs (e.g., Dive-XL acting as a mothership), Unmanned Surface Vessels
                    (USVs), submarines (e.g., via standard torpedo tubes or external UUV launchers for -500 series),
                    surface ships (tube or crane launched), and potentially aircraft (via sonobuoy-like deployment for
                    smaller variants - speculative). Features a mountable hull design or can be tube-launched. Modular
                    design allows for payload and battery section customization.
                  </li>
                  <li>

                    low-power, high-performance SoCs - estimated) for autonomous navigation (INS with DVL aiding,
                    potentially vision/sonar-aided SLAM in littoral areas), real-time object detection (e.g., mines,
                    other UUVs, submarines, surface vessels using onboard sonar/optics), classification based on
                    acoustic/visual signatures, tracking, and intelligent obstacle avoidance. Supports collaborative
                    operations with other Anduril assets (e.g., receiving cues from Seabed Sentries or Dive AUVs) via
                    Lattice OS through acoustic or RF links when surfaced/near-surface.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Copperhead-M (Munition):</strong> Munition variant designed for torpedo-like effects against
                    underwater or surface targets. Warhead type estimated as shaped charge for anti-submarine/anti-ship
                    roles (optimized for penetrating hulls) or specialized charges for mine countermeasures (e.g.,
                    high-explosive neutralization charges). Payload capacity varies by 100/500 series (e.g.,
                    Copperhead-500M could carry a warhead comparable to a lightweight torpedo, e.g., 20-50 kg HE -
                    estimated). Advanced fuzing options (contact, proximity via acoustic/magnetic sensors, timed -
                    estimated). Terminal guidance likely via active/passive acoustic homing and/or EO/IR for surface
                    targets.
                  </li>

                    Used for reconnaissance, surveillance, target cueing for other assets, or deploying small payloads
                    (e.g., mini-sensors, comms relays).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Sub-systems & Comms:</strong> Features an acoustically optimized hull and quiet electric
                    motor for reduced detection signature. Advanced sonar systems (e.g., multi-beam FLS, passive arrays
                    - estimated). Robust command and control links: acoustic modems (e.g., JANUS-compliant or
                    proprietary LPI/LPD ACOMMS) for underwater C2 and low-rate data transfer, RF links (e.g., WiFi,
                    cellular, SATCOM) when surfaced or near surface via a retractable mast, and potentially fiber optic
                    for tethered operations or initial programming/data download.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Interoperability:</strong> Networked with Lattice OS via its host platform or direct
                    communication links for mission tasking, real-time updates (when comms allow), and data
                    exfiltration. Can receive target information from distributed sensors and provide its own sensor
                    data back to the network.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Anduril's Edge:</strong> Provides affordable, high-speed, autonomous underwater capabilities
                    for ISR, mine countermeasures (MCM), anti-submarine warfare (ASW), and interdiction. Designed for
                    scalable production and potential attritable operations if necessary, embodying Anduril's philosophy
                    of bringing mass and software-defined adaptability to underwater warfare.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Size & Payload Capacity:</strong> Classified as an Extra Large Autonomous Underwater Vehicle
                    (XL-AUV), "school-bus size". Significantly larger payload volume (estimated >10-20 m¬≥, potentially
                    configurable sections) and weight capacity (estimated several thousand kilograms, e.g., >2,000-5,000
                    kg / 2-5 tons) compared to Dive-LD. Designed to accommodate multiple large payloads, a single
                    extra-large mission module, or deployment of smaller AUVs/UUVs (e.g., Copperhead, Seabed Sentry).
                    Can integrate standard torpedo-sized interfaces or custom large mission systems.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Deployment & Logistics:</strong> Designed to fit within standard 40-foot ISO shipping
                    containers for ease of global transport and deployment from a wide range of vessels of opportunity
                    (e.g., Offshore Supply Vessels (OSVs), amphibious ships, littoral combat ships) or dedicated support
                    ships, minimizing reliance on specialized infrastructure.
                  </li>
                  <li>

                    All-electric powertrain with a very high-capacity Lithium-ion battery system (estimated hundreds of
                    kWh, potentially scalable to MWh class with energy-dense battery technology) enables extended
                    undersea operations (weeks to potentially months - estimated depending on speed/payload and hotel
                    load). Aiming for a 1,000 nautical mile fully submerged mission in 2025, with plans for
                    multi-thousand-mile range. Capable of autonomously deploying and recovering smaller assets like
                    Seabed Sentries or Copperhead AUVs from integrated payload bays or dispenser systems. Sophisticated
                    autonomy for long-range transit, mission execution, and fault tolerance.
                  </li>

                    <strong>Primary Applications (Ghost Shark Program Context):</strong>
                    Strategic seabed ISR and influence, persistent intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR) over
                    vast maritime areas, large-area survey and mapping, clandestine delivery and recovery of payloads
                    (e.g., sensors, mines, UUVs), forward-deployed sensor network emplacement and maintenance,
                    Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) operations (e.g., deploying large towed arrays, active/passive sonar
                    barriers, or multiple smaller networked sensors), strike missions (with appropriate munition
                    payloads), and serving as a "mothership" for smaller UUVs/AUVs, extending their operational reach.
                    Mobile mine-laying capability.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Comms & Navigation:</strong> Similar advanced suite to Dive-LD, featuring robust acoustic
                    modems (multiple types for redundancy and adaptability), multiple SATCOM links (e.g., Iridium for

                    <strong>Networked Autonomous Sensing:</strong> Designed as mobile, 'cable-less' deep-sea nodes to be
                    deployed in numbers to form a Lattice-connected wireless underwater sensor network. Provides
                    persistent, wide-area surveillance of maritime chokepoints, harbors, critical infrastructure, and
                    strategic areas. Data is processed at the edge on each Sentry and relevant information/tracks are
                    relayed within the network and to Lattice OS via gateway nodes (e.g., AUVs, USVs, or buoys).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Mission Lifetime & Power:</strong> Engineered for long-duration emplacement, with a mission
                    lifetime of months to potentially years, powered by high-energy-density, long-life batteries (e.g.,
                    Lithium Thionyl Chloride or similar primary cells - estimated). Low power electronics and
                    intelligent power management extend operational life. Modular and reusable design allows for
                    recovery, recharge/refurbishment, and redeployment.

                    inter-sentry networking and communication with nearby AUVs/UUVs (e.g., Dive-XL for data
                    exfil/tasking) or surface gateways. Data rates are typically low (tens to hundreds of bps,
                    potentially up to a few kbps using advanced modulation - estimated) but optimized for robust
                    long-range (km to tens of km - estimated) and reliable communication in challenging underwater
                    acoustic channels. Employs Lattice-enabled edge compute for data processing.

                    <strong>Underlying Mechanism:</strong> The lithium component in the alloy reacts exothermically with
                    certain combustion byproducts (e.g., chlorine from ammonium perchlorate oxidizer), releasing
                    additional heat and increasing the overall energy of combustion. The alloy's carefully controlled
                    particle size and morphology also contribute to improved burn rate characteristics, combustion
                    efficiency, and reduced two-phase flow losses compared to standard aluminum.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Integration & Formulation:</strong> Designed as a "drop-in" replacement or augmentation for
                    standard aluminum powder in various existing and new solid propellant formulations (e.g., HTPB,
                    PBAN, double-base propellants). Requires specialized mixing and handling protocols due to the
                    reactivity of lithium, but leverages Anduril's advanced energetic material processing capabilities.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Target Applications:</strong> Hypersonic missiles (boosters and potentially ramjet/scramjet
                    sustainers if applicable to solid ducted rockets), tactical missiles (air-to-air, surface-to-air,
                    surface-to-surface, anti-ship), sounding rockets, small launch vehicles, missile defense
                    interceptors (e.g., SM-6 variant development ), and artillery rockets (e.g., potential for increased

                  <li>
                    <strong>Programmatic Context & Development:</strong> Developed in response to the rapidly growing
                    demand from the DoD and other agencies for affordable, reliable, and high-volume hypersonic boosters
                    to support various national security programs. Part of Anduril's strategic DPA Title III investment
                    to expand and modernize the US solid rocket motor industrial base. Multiple successful static test
                    firings have been conducted, validating design and performance predictions. Anduril is also working
                    on a 21-inch diameter SRM for the Navy's SM-6 variant.

                    <strong>Anduril's Edge:</strong> Denali uniquely combines cutting-edge propellant technology
                    (ALITEC) with innovative manufacturing processes (bladeless speedmixing, automated single-piece
                    flow) to deliver high-performance hypersonic boosters at scale and at a disruptive price point. This
                    addresses a critical national defense need for more accessible and mass-producible hypersonic
                    systems, directly aligning with Anduril's mission to bring speed and innovation to defense
                    procurement.
